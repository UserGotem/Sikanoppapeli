# Sikanoppapeli - A Dice Rolling Game

Welcome to Sikanoppapeli, a simple yet addictive dice rolling game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Challenge your friends or AI opponents in two exciting game modes: one-dice or two-dice, and see who can get the highest score!

## Game Modes

### One-Dice Mode

In one-dice mode, each player takes turns rolling a single die. The player with the highest roll wins the round. The first player to reach a predetermined score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.

### Two-Dice Mode

In two-dice mode, each player rolls two dice simultaneously. The player with the highest combined roll wins the round. The first player to reach a predetermined score (e.g., 150 points) wins the game.

## Adding Players

To add players, simply enter their names and select the desired game mode. You can play against up to three human players or against AI opponents.

## Gameplay

Once the players are added, the game starts. Each player takes turns rolling the dice according to the chosen game mode. The player with the highest roll (or highest combined roll in two-dice mode) wins the round and scores the number shown on the dice. The game continues until one player reaches the predetermined score and wins the game.
